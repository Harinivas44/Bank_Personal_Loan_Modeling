# Bank Personal Loan Modeling 🏦💰

# Project Overview

This project is all about predicting whether a bank's customers will accept a personal loan offer or not. We've used various machine learning models to make these predictions. 🤖📈
# 🔍 Data Exploration

Utilized a dataset containing information about bank customers. It includes details like age, experience, income, family size, credit card average spending (CCAvg), education level, mortgage, and more.

### Data Exploration

I have started by exploring the dataset:

* Checked for missing values: No missing data found. 🧐

* Examined data types: The dataset consists of integers and floating-point numbers. 💹

* Descriptive statistics: Analyzed data distribution, ranges, and central tendencies. 📊

### Data Visualization

Utilized visualizations for better data understanding:

* Pair Plot: Visualized relationships between different features. 📊📈

# Model Building

I employed the following machine learning models for predictions:

* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes

### Model Training

The dataset was split into training and testing sets for model training and prediction:

* Logistic Regression: Achieved approximately 70.3% training and 71.4% testing accuracy. 📉📈

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Achieved approximately 70.5% training and 70.4% testing accuracy. 🏘️🏡

* Gaussian Naive Bayes: Outperformed other models with around 74.0% training and 74.5% testing accuracy. 📊🚀

# Conclusion

This project successfully predicts whether bank customers will accept personal loan offers. Among the models, Gaussian Naive Bayes performed the best in both training and testing, making it the recommended model for this task. 🎉🚀
